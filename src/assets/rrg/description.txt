The Running Route Generator is an Android application that provides a unique experience for avid runners. Select from loops, segments, and out & backs. Select from cardinal directions. Input location, distance, elevation gain, and search radius. With this, RRG will generate a route for you that can be saved to your library.

Custom route drawing:
You can draw custom routes by dropping markers on a map. RRG will measure distance, elevation gain, and elevation loss for all routes including your custom routes. 

Run planning:
RRG provides a run planner, with which runs can be planned with your saved routes. Saved routes can be sorted/filtered to fit the needs of any given run based on factors such as distance and elevation.

Live GPS location tracking:
Opening one of your saved routes will open the route in a map, including a marker for your current location which will provide live tracking allowing you to look at your progress along your route throughout your run.

The Running Route Generator is designed to work in any country for various activities such as: running, walking, cycling/biking, etc.
